# Project Overview: Stage 1

The project aims to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application, as part of Udacity FEND Nanodegree.

# How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the project on your local computer.

2. In the project folder start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 

3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
